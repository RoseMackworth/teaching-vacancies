# Hosting

Teaching Vacancies is hosted on GOV.UK PaaS. When onboarded you will be added to the [`dfe-teacher-services` organisation](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/orgs_spaces_users.html#organisations) and the relevant spaces. Note that this is different to GitHub.com where you will be added to the [`DFE-Digital` organization](https://github.com/DFE-Digital)

These are the running applications:

- https://dev.teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk (Dev)
- https://staging.teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk (Staging)
- https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk (Production)

Plus all the ephemeral review apps that are created when a PR is created on GitHub, and destroyed when the PR is merged.

The Dev environment has integration with DSI. It is "user-deployable", in that developers can deploy via:
- pushing code to the `dev` branch
- Makefile commands outlined below

The Staging environment is a pre-production environment, to identify issues with code before it's promoted to Production.
On merging a Pull Request, the same code is deployed first to Staging, and after a successful smoke test, to Production.

## Install Cloud Foundry CLI on Mac

```bash
brew install cloudfoundry/tap/cf-cli@7
```

## Login

```bash
CF_API_ENDPOINT=https://api.london.cloud.service.gov.uk
CF_ORG=dfe-teacher-services
```

`$CF_SPACE` is the environment(space) you want to deal with, these are the available ones:

* teaching-vacancies-dev
* teaching-vacancies-staging
* teaching-vacancies-production
* teaching-vacancies-monitoring
* teaching-vacancies-review

For convenience and for security reasons we recommend to use SSO to login:

```bash
cf login --sso -a $CF_API_ENDPOINT -o $CF_ORG -s $CF_SPACE
```

If you need to login with a service account to access production environment:

```bash
cf login -a $CF_API_ENDPOINT -u $CF_USERNAME -p $CF_PASSWORD -o $CF_ORG -s $CF_SPACE
```

## Check space users

```bash
cf space-users $CF_ORG $CF_SPACE
```

## Check organization users

```bash
cf org-users $CF_ORG -a
```

## Set/unset SpaceDeveloper role

```bash
cf set-space-role USER_ID $CF_ORG $CF_SPACE SpaceDeveloper
cf unset-space-role USER_ID $CF_ORG $CF_SPACE SpaceDeveloper
```

## Check running apps

```bash
cf apps
```

There should be 2 apps (more in the case of review apps space):

- webapp: it has a route to serve requests from users
- worker: it subscribe to redis to run asynchronous jobs

## Check running services

```bash
cf services
```

## Check app health and status

```bash
cf app <app_name>
```

## Check environment variables

```bash
cf env <app_name>
```

## Set environment variable

Environment variables are stored in AWS SSM Parameter store and in the repository. Terraform sets them automatically when it deploys the applications to GOV.UK PaaS.

Should you wish to override an individual variable directly:

```bash
cf set-env <app_name> ENV_VAR_NAME env_var_value
cf restart <app_name> --strategy rolling
```

Remember to restart the app, using `--strategy rolling` if you wish to avoid downtime.
In the case of changing environment variables used only by the app, `restart` is sufficient and `restage` is unnecessary:

```bash
cf restart <app_name> --strategy rolling
```

## SSH into app

```bash
cf ssh <app_name>
```

## Access Rails console

```bash
cf ssh <app_name>
cd /teacher-vacancy
/usr/local/bin/bundle exec rails console
```

## Run task

```bash
cf run-task <app_name> -c "rails task:name"
```

## Deploy to dev via commandline

This builds and deploys a Docker image from local code, then updates the `dev` environment to use that image

```bash
passcode=<passcode> make <environment> deploy-local-image
```
performs these steps:

- Builds and tags a Docker image from local code
- Pushes the image to Docker Hub
- Uses Terraform to apply any changes (including providing the tag of the Docker image) to the `dev` environment

You need:
- Write access to Docker Hub `dfedigital/teaching-vacancies` repository. Ask in #digital-tools-support should you require it.
- `SpaceDeveloper` role in the PaaS space you want to deploy to
- Log in to Docker Hub (with `docker login`) and GOV.UK PaaS in your terminal
- Obtain SSO passcode from https://login.london.cloud.service.gov.uk/passcode

## Update dev with an existing Docker image

This allows you to update the `dev` environment to use a previously-built Docker image

```bash
passcode=<passcode> tag=47fd1475376bbfa16a773693133569b794408995 make <environment> terraform-app-apply
```
performs these steps:

- Uses Terraform to apply any changes (including providing the tag of the Docker image) to the `dev` environment

You need:
- `SpaceDeveloper` role in the PaaS space you want to deploy to
- Log in to Docker Hub (with `docker login`) and GOV.UK PaaS in your terminal
- Obtain SSO passcode from https://login.london.cloud.service.gov.uk/passcode

## Deploy to dev via a commit to GitHub

This builds and deploys a Docker image from code in the `dev` branch.

Push to the `dev` branch.
The GitHub actions workflow [deploy_branch.yml](/.github/workflows/deploy_branch.yml) performs these steps:

- Builds and tags a Docker image from code in the GitHub branch
- Pushes the image to Docker Hub
- Uses Terraform to apply any changes (including providing the tag of the Docker image) to the `dev` environment
- Sends a Slack notification to the `#twd_tv_dev` channel

## CI/CD with GitHub Actions

Tests run every time is pushed on a branch.

When a PR is approved and merged into `master` branch, the GitHub actions workflow [deploy.yml](/.github/workflows/deploy) performs these steps:

- Builds and tags a Docker image from code in the GitHub branch
- Pushes the image to Docker Hub
- Uses Terraform to apply any changes (including providing the tag of the Docker image) to the `staging` environment
- Runs a smoke test against the `staging` environment
- Uses Terraform to apply any changes (including providing the tag of the Docker image) to the `production` environment
- Sends a Slack notification to the `#twd_tv_dev` channel

## Maintenance windows for GOV.UK PaaS Postgres and Redis services

From [Redis maintenance times](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/deploying_services/redis/#redis-maintenance-times)

> Every Redis service has a maintenance window of Sunday 11pm to Monday 1:30am UTC every week.

From [PostgreSQL maintenance times](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/deploying_services/postgresql/#postgresql-maintenance-times):

> Each PostgreSQL service you create will have a randomly-assigned weekly 30 minute maintenance window, during which there may be brief downtime. Select a high availability (HA) plan to minimise this downtime. Minor version upgrades (for example from 9.4.1 to 9.4.2) are applied during this maintenance window.
>
> Window start times will vary from 22:00 to 06:00 UTC.

Discussed with Product Owner

- Redis - leave as Sunday 23:00 to Monday 01:30
- Postgres staging - set as Tuesday 23:16 to Tuesday 23:46
- Postgres production - set as Wednesday 23:16 to Wednesday 23:46

With the intention being:
- maintenance overnight on Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday mean any issues can be remediated on working days (Monday, Wednesday, Thursday)
- this avoid Tuesday as sprint ceremonies day, and Friday when fewer people are working
- staging happens a day before production, so that we can detect failures in the lower environment first

We set these with the CloudFoundry CLI commands, opting for the safer option of applying this configuration change during a maintenance window:
```
cf update-service teaching-vacancies-postgres-staging -p small-11 -c '{"apply_at_maintenance_window": true, "preferred_maintenance_window": "tue:23:16-tue:23:46"}'
cf update-service teaching-vacancies-postgres-production -p medium-ha-11 -c '{"apply_at_maintenance_window": true, "preferred_maintenance_window": "wed:23:16-wed:23:46"}'
```

## Backup/Restore GOV.UK PaaS Postgres service database

Install Conduit plugin

```bash
cf install-plugin conduit
```

### Backup

```bash
cf conduit $CF_POSTGRES_SERVICE_ORIGIN -- pg_dump -x --no-owner -c -f backup.sql
```

### Restore

```bash
cf conduit $CF_POSTGRES_SERVICE_TARGET -- psql < backup.sql
```

## Set up a new environment
- Create file `terraform/workspace-variables/<env>.tfvars`
- Create file `terraform/workspace-variables/<env>_app_env.yml`
- Create SSM parameters of type `SecureString`:
  - `/teaching-vacancies/<env>/app/BIG_QUERY_API_JSON_KEY`
  - `/teaching-vacancies/<env>/app/GOOGLE_API_JSON_KEY`
  - `/teaching-vacancies/<env>/app/secrets`
  - `/teaching-vacancies/<env>/infra/secrets`
- Run:
  ```shell
  cd terraform/app
  export TF_VAR_paas_sso_passcode=<passcode obtained from https://login.london.cloud.service.gov.uk/passcode>
  export TF_WORKSPACE=<env>
  export TF_VAR_paas_app_docker_image=dfedigital/teaching-vacancies:<tag>
  terraform init
  terraform apply -var-file terraform/workspace-variables/<env>.tfvars
  ```

## Remove a review app environment

In usual circumstances, the review apps lifecycle will be handled via GitHub Actions
- creation via the [`review.yml`](.github/workflows/review.yml) workflow on PR open or update
- destruction via the [`destroy.yml`](.github/workflows/destroy.yml) workflow on PR close

We can use the Makefile to destroy a review app, by passing a `CONFIRM_DESTROY=true` plus changing the action to `review-destroy`:
```
make pr=2068 CONFIRM_DESTROY=true passcode=MyPasscode review review-destroy
```

If that still does not work, it's possible to remove the individual resources via the CF command line

Log in to Gov.UK PaaS
Switch to the review space:
```
cf target -s teaching-vacancies-review
```

List, then delete, apps and routes
```
cf apps
cf delete -r teaching-vacancies-review-pr-2068
cf delete -r teaching-vacancies-worker-review-pr-2068
```

List, then delete, services
```
cf services
cf delete-service teaching-vacancies-postgres-review-pr-2068
cf delete-service teaching-vacancies-redis-review-pr-2068
cf delete-service teaching-vacancies-papertrail-review-pr-2068
```
